### Description of Process Roles

- The parent process creates Child 1.
- Child 1 creates Child 2 and Child 3.
- Child 2 creates Child 4 and Child 5.
- Child 3 creates Child 6 and Child 7.
- Child 4–7 terminate immediately after execution.
- After each process is executed, it will be print to the terminal

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Fork System Call

The `fork()` system call 

- The child process receives a return value of `0` from `fork()`.
- The parent process receives the PID of the child process.

---

### 2. Process Identification

Each process prints:

- Its own Process ID (PID) using `getpid()`
- Its Parent Process ID (PPID) using `getppid()`

These values help demonstrate correct process hierarchy.

---

### 3. Process Synchronization

The program uses the `wait()` system call to ensure:

- Parent processes wait for child processes to terminate before continuing execution.
- This prevents zombie processes from being created.

## Development Environment

This program was developed and tested using:

- Linux-based VM environment (Tuffix)
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC/G++)
- C++ programming language

---

## Compilation/Running Instructions
To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ processes.cpp -o processes

To Run the program, use the following command:
./processes

## Special Notes 

We used chatgpt minimally to help us understand how implement fork(). Originally, we looked at the lecture slides with examples of how fork() was inputed, but the system was saying that we were doing something wrong, so we used chatgpt to guide us in that small line of code. Other than that we mainly used the lecture slides from week 3 and online resources like Stack Overflow and GeeksforGeeks to comfirm if what we were doing was logically correct!
